# Accstore
Here I bulid a basic GUI that stores your emails, password and account information.For Access enter 'Khushi'. As due to multiple accounts we used to forget our own access somtimes.Through this we can add our data and save it for future needs. 
You can also run Account-Storage in Gitpod, a free online dev environment for GitHub:
